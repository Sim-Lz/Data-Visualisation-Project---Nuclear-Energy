# Data-Visualisation-Project---Nuclear-Energy

Consumption: this script shows the process to obtain the dataset from the Terna web site and it precedes the analysis on energy consumption.
limits_IT_provinces: this is the file with the Italian provinces coordinates used to create the dataset used for consumption analysis.
ANALYSIS_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION: this script contains the process for obtaining, cleaning and pre-processing the dataset on energy consumption levels. The dataset was then used to create the final visualizations in Power BI. 
Production: this script shows the process to obtain the dataset from the Terna web site and it precedes the analysis on energy production.
ANALYSIS_ENERGY_PRODUCTION: this script contains the process for obtaining, cleaning and pre-processing the dataset on energy production levels. The dataset was then used to create the final visualizations in Power BI.
Public_opinion: this script contains the process to obtain data to generate the word cloud.
Cloud_mask: this is the image used to give the shape to the word cloud.
Environmental_impact: this is the script that contains the passages to obtain the dataset used to generate the graph for the environmental impact.
Consumo.csv: this is the csv file used to begin the study on energy consumption over Italy
7 - DATI STORICI_8dbcf15b32ba0bd.pdf: this is the pdf file we begin from, to develop our study on energy production 
DATI STORICI 2.csv: this dataset serves as a shortcut for the study on energy production. Data processing started from "7 - DATI STORICI_8dbcf15b32ba0bd.pdf" may take a while, so it is preferible to upload directly this csv file in order to avoid the code running to optain it
Comments.csv: this is the dataset comprising comments and opinions regarding nuclear energy collected on social platforms
Env_impact_per_sources.csv: this dataset provides all the information useful to get a deep understanding on the impact that each energy source has on environment and human beings
